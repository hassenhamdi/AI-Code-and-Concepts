# üß† AI Code & Concepts

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of fundamental Artificial Intelligence concepts, each implemented from scratch in clear, well-commented Python. It is designed for students, developers, and researchers who want to understand *how* these powerful systems work, not just *how to use* them.

## Our Philosophy

This project is guided by a few core principles to maximize learning and understanding:

*   üìö **Clarity First:** Code is written to be read and understood. The primary goal is education, not optimization or feature-completeness.
*   üéØ **Focused Implementations:** Each script targets a single, core concept (like a U-Net, a VAE, or a training technique like LoRA).
*   üß© **Self-Contained:** Implementations have minimal dependencies and are free from the boilerplate of large production frameworks, allowing you to focus on the algorithm itself.

## How to Use This Repository

This project is meant to be studied, not just run.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hassenhamdi/AI-Code-and-Concepts.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate** into a concept folder that interests you.
3.  **Read the code and its `README.md`:** Each concept has its own dedicated `README.md` file that explains the architecture and the role of each script. The primary way to use this repository is to read the source code and the extensive comments.

## Featured Concepts

Each major AI concept is organized into its own dedicated folder.

### [Stable Diffusion](./Stable%20Diffusion)

A deep dive into the architecture of modern latent diffusion models. This section breaks down the complete text-to-image pipeline into its essential, self-contained components, explaining each part of the generative process from text prompt to final image.
